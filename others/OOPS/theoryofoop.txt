*Class & Object:~

        class is a blueprint for creating object

        #creating class

        class Student:
            name = "Parth"

        #creating object(instance)

        s1 = Student()
        print(s1.name)


Constructor:~

        All classes have a function called _init_(),which is always executed when the object is being initiated.

        #creating class

        class Student:
            def __init__(self,fullname):
                self.name=fullname

        #creating object

        s1=Student("parth")
        print(s1.name)

        here 'the self parameter is a reference to the currene=t instance of class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.'


Methods:~

        methods are function that belong to object

        #creating Class

        class Student:
            def __init__(self,fullname):
                self.name=fullname

            def hello(self):
                print("hello",self.name)

        #creating object

        s1=Student("parth")
        s1.hello()

Static Method:~

        methods that don't use the self parrmeter (work at class level)

        class Student:
            @Staticmethod   #decorator

            def college():
                print("ABC college")


        *decorator allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function,without permanently modifying initiated*

Important:~
        *Abstraction:
            hiding the implementation details of a class and onluy showing the essential features to the user.
        *Encapsulation:
            wrapping data and function into a single unit(object)
        *Inheritance:
        *Polymorphism:

del Keyword:~
        used to delete object properties or object itself

        del s1.name
        del s1

private(like) atrributes & methods:~

        conceptual implementation in pythod
            private atrributes & methods are ment to be used only within the class and are not 
            accessible from outside the class.

Inheritance:~
        when one class(child/detived) derives the properties & methods of another class(parent/base).

        class car:
            .......
            .......

        class Toyotacar(car):
            .......

        *types:~
            ~>single Inheritance
            ~>Multi-level Inheritance
            ~>Multiple Inheritance

*super method:~

        super() method is used to access methods pf the parent class

class method:~

        A class method us bound to the class & receives the class as an implicit first argument

        note:-static method can't access or modify class state & generally for utility.

        class Student:
        @classmethod #decorator

        def college(cls):
            pass    

Polymorphism :operator overloading:~

        when the same operator is allowed to have different meaning according to the context

        operator&Dunder function:-

        a + b #add              a.__add__(b) 
        a - b #sub              a.__sub__(b) 
        a * b #mul              a.__mul____(b) 
        a / b #division         a.__truediv____(b) 
        a % b #modulo           a.__mod____(b)
